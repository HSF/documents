\abstract{The rapidly increasing evolution of technology and the parallel increasing complexity of algorithmic analysis in HEP (and in science in general) require a much larger portfolio of specific skills by the developers with respect to the past. Young researchers, graduating from universities worldwide, currently do not receive adequate preparation in the very diverse fields of modern computing to respond to growing necessities posed by the most advanced experimental challenges. The vast majority of the HEP community strongly agrees on the need for an overarching umbrella of training programs to bring young researchers (but also more mature ones) up to date with new software technologies, such as, for example, concurrent programming and artificial intelligence. }
