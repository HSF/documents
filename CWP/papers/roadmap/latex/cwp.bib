  abstract={The CernVM File System (CernVM-FS) is a read-only file system designed to deliver high energy physics (HEP) experiment analysis software onto virtual machines and Grid worker nodes in a fast, scalable, and reliable way. CernVM-FS decouples the underlying operating system from the experiment denned software stack. Files and file metadata are aggressively cached and downloaded on demand. By designing the file system specifically to the use case of HEP software repositories and experiment conditions data, several typically hard problems for (distributed) file systems can be solved in an elegant way. For the distribution of files, we use a standard HTTP transport, which allows exploitation of a variety of web caches, including commercial content delivery networks. We ensure data authenticity and integrity over possibly untrusted caches and connections while keeping all distributed data cacheable. On the small scale, we developed an experimental extension that allows multiple CernVM-FS instances in a computing cluster to discover each other and to share their file caches.}

  abstract={The ATLAS experiment's data management system is constantly tracing file movement operations that occur on the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG). Due to the large scale of the WLCG, statistical analysis of the traces is infeasible in real-time. Factors that contribute to the scalability problems include the capability for users to initiate on-demand queries, high dimensionality of tracer entries combined with very low cardinality parameters, and the large size of the namespace. These scalability issues are alleviated through the adoption of an incremental model that aggregates data for all combinations occurring in selected tracer fields on a daily basis. Using this model it is possible to query on-demand relevant statistics about system usage. We present an implementation of this popularity model in the experiment's distributed data management system, DQ2, and describe a direct application example of the popularity framework, an automated cleaning system, which uses the statistics to dynamically detect and reduce unpopular replicas from grid sites. This paper describes the architecture employed by the cleaning system and reports on the results collected from a prototype during the first months of the ATLAS collision data taking.}

  abstract={After a successful data taking period at the CERN LHC by the major physics experiments (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb) since 2009, a long-term plan is already envisaged to fully exploit the vast physics potential of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) within the next two decades. The CERN accelerator complex will undergo a series of upgrades leading ultimately to increase both the collision energy and the luminosity, thus maximizing the amount of data delivered to all experiments. As a consequence, the experiments have also to cope with very high detector occupancies and operate in the hard radiation environment caused by a huge multiplicity of particles produced in each beam crossing. In parallel to the accelerator upgrades, the LHC experiments are planning various upgrades to their detector, trigger, and data acquisition systems. The main motivation for the upgrades is to extend and to improve their physics programme also in the increasingly challenging LHC environment. In this paper a general overview of the upgrade programme of the major experiments at LHC will be given, with some additional details concerning specifications and physics programme of new detector subsystems.}

  abstract={The future of CP-Violation experiments is to begin in 2014 with the launch of the SuperKEKB collider in Tsukuba, Japan. As a part of this process the BELLE experiment will undergo an upgrade, giving rise to the BELLE II experiment. The BELLE II detector will include improvements and redesigns of various subdetectors, as well as the addition of an entire new subdetector for precise vertexing. In order to reflect these changes in the existing BELLE software framework, major modifications of nearly all parts of the software would have been necessary. As a result the decision was made to completely rewrite the software framework. In this article the main concepts of the new framework and the applied technologies are presented.}

  abstract={Since 2014 the ATLAS and CMS experiments share a common vision on the database infrastructure for the handling of the non-event data in forthcoming LHC runs. The wide commonality in the use cases has allowed to agree on a common overall design solution that is meeting the requirements of both experiments. A first prototype has been completed in 2016 and has been made available to both experiments. The prototype is based on a web service implementing a REST api with a set of functions for the management of conditions data. In this contribution, we describe this prototype architecture and the tests that have been performed within the CMS computing infrastructure, with the aim of validating the support of the main use cases and of suggesting future improvements.}
